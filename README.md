# python-meetup
We meet in Conference Room F on a Wednesday at around 12:30pm (check Ron's calendar in case of occasional variation)
The idea is that we can bring along a brown bag lunch and work together as a support group through the lunch break.
There is a [slack channel](https://tna-digital.slack.com/messages/CADPHUVL0/details/) on TNA-Digital

## Challenges
Let's list any tasks we'd like to complete with Python. We could then work on real world useful things.
- Guy would like to extract a list of catalogue descriptions, given a list of document references
- Given a container-type document reference (eg a Piece with multiple items, or a series), look up the images that comprise the digital download files, fetch them and write them to a directory structure for someone to browse.
- Given a container type (such as a Catalogue Series), fetch all the descendent pieces, items etc and output to a document
