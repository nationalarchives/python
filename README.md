## Challenges
Let's list any tasks we'd like to complete with Python. We could then work on real world useful things.
- Guy would like to extract a list of catalogue descriptions, given a list of document references
- Given a container-type document reference (eg a Piece with multiple items, or a series), look up the images that comprise the digital download files, fetch them and write them to a directory structure for someone to browse.
- Given a container type (such as a Catalogue Series), fetch all the descendent pieces, items etc and output to a document
